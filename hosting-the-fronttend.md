How to Implement:

Host your static frontend files (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) on an object storage service like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
Configure a CDN, such as AWS CloudFront or Cloudflare, to distribute and cache your static assets globally.
Route traffic to your CDN endpoint, which will handle requests for static content.
